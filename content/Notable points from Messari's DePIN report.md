# DePIN Overview
- DePIN = Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks that use crypto-incentives to efficiently **coordinate the buildout & operation of critical infrastructure on top of public blockchains**.
- **DePIN sectors include following sectors (non-exhaustive)**, that build on top of blockchain:
	- Wireless
	- Energy
	- Compute
	- Sensors
	- Logistics
	- Identity

- **DePIN empowers & incentivizes people to improve public infrastructure around them**. It transfers wealth & power back to citizens & communities. The infrastructure may include:
	- Digital maps
	- Energy grid
	- AI
	- Telcos
	- Datacenters
	- Power plants
	- Carbon credits
	- Home internet
	- Food delivery
	- Knowledge work
	- Ride-sharing
	- Advertising
	- Mobility
	- Health & Fitness
	- Pets & Livestock
- DePIN is how the majority of humanity will onboard onto the crypto economy.
- DePIN is like AGI reaching back in time to create the resources it needs to thrive.
- Generating a 5-second video today costs >$0.10 in compute, electricity & bandwidth. Advanced AIs will demand these digital commodities at an unimaginable scale.

- **DePIN is the first triple-point business model capable of spawning $10T+ networks**. DePIN Flywheels combine the economies of scale of traditional infrastructure (1), with the network effects of a tech platform (2), and the liquidity moats of a currency (3).

- **DePIN is in its earliest innings with <0.1% market share of $1T+ end-markets**. DePIN will grow 100-1000x over the next decade as networks win market share from centralized corporations with slower, less reliable and less dynamic offerings.

# DePIN Supply
- Most DePINs combine light nodes for low onboarding friction & new user acquisition with heavy nodes for stronger and more reliable network performance.

- More than 13 million devices globally contribute to DePINs every single day. Twenty DePINs grew to >100k active nodes in 2024, five of which are now above 1m nodes
